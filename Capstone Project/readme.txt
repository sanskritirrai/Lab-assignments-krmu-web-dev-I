**My Capstone Project**

**ARENYX – Acubi / Y2K Fashion Landing Page**
A modern, aesthetic, single-page fashion website inspired by Acubi, Y2K, and dark couture themes.
The project includes multiple scroll-linked sections (Shop, Bestsellers, New Drops, Accessories, Street Couture, New Arrivals, Contact, etc.) all inside one HTML page.

A bold, dark-aesthetic fashion brand website created using pure HTML + CSS only, featuring smooth layout, category navigation, and a clean storefront design.

**The landing page is built with structured sections that create a complete shopping-style experience:**

Hero Section: Full-screen banner with tagline, buttons, and scroll navigation.
Categories: Red-black cards linking to different sections on the page.
Shop Section: A grid of products with filters on the side.
New Arrivals: Recently added fashion pieces displayed inn a clean grid.
Bestsellers: Popular products shown using a product card layout.
New Drops: A smaller collection of newly released items.
Street Couture: High-street inspired clothing selection.
Accessories Section: Chains, hats, glasses, etc., displayed inn a grid.
Testimonials: Customer reviews inn cards.
Newsletter Subscription: Email input to capture user interest.
Footer: Brand tagline, important links, and copyright.

All links use internal anchor navigation, meaning each menu option scrolls smoothly to its section within the same page.

The website follows a mobile-first approach with responsive design. Techniques including :
Flexbox forr horizontal alignment (navbar, testimonial cards, category cards).
CSS Grid forr all product sections (bestsellers, new drops, shop grid).
Media Queries forr responsiveness at common breakpoints:
768px (tablet)
1024px (small laptops)
1200px+ (large screens)
These breakpoints ensure the layout adapts properly on phones, tablets, and desktops.
