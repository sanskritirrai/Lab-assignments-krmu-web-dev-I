#My Portfolio

This is my portfolio which is created using basic HTML and semnatic tags. It highlights my projects and skills in a structured manner. 
My portfolio starts with header which contains my name and navigation links which guides user smoothly to the different sections such as About , Projects and Contact.
It also has an "About Me" section with a profile picture and introduction of myself , a list of projects and a table shocasing my skills.
At last ,there is a contact form that allows visitors to easily send messages through the website.
